color.rb currently has a namespace clash with color-tools, which is required by PDF::Writer. A fix is in the work.

Color
=====

A simple library for dealing with colors. Currently it features:

Conversion:
  RGB Int <-> RGB Hex
  HSL <-> RGB
  RGB <-> CMYK
  RGB -> HSV

Manipulation:
  Mixing colors
  Adjusting Hue, Saturation, or Lightness values of a color
  
Future plans include #to_web_safe, a palette (fe: Color.new(:black)), 
color wheel traversing ( Color.new(:red).compliment == Color.new(:green) ),
and possibly color scheme suggestions (analagous, etc).

Usage
=====

require 'color'
=> true
red = Color.new('ff0000')
=> #<Color:0x352fd0 @hue=0.0, @lightness=0.5, @rgb=[255, 0, 0], @saturation=1.0>
yellow = Color.new('ffff00')
=> #<Color:0x34bb18 @hue=0.166666666666667, @lightness=0.5, @rgb=[255, 255, 0], @saturation=1.0>
orange = red.mix_with yellow, 0.5
=> #<Color:0x33dea0 @hue=0.0830065359477123, @lightness=0.5, @rgb=[255, 127, 0], @saturation=1.0>
orange.to_hex
=> "#ff7f00"
orange.lightness += 0.2
=> 0.7
orange.to_hex
=> "#ffb266"

This is alpha-quality software. It works according to general poking and prodding, but at this point all of half a morning has been spent on it. The API is subject to change.
